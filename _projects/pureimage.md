Pureimage is a discord bot used to detect duplicate images and delete them. It does this by using perceptual image hashing.

Pureimage was my first project that showed any actual success, at it's peak it was used in 12 servers. It's written in discord.py and makes use of perceptual image hashing in order to detect if two images are the same, additionally using standard hashing as a fallback. However, I lost in interest in the project after some time as well as suffering from technical debt to due bad architecture. I've tried to rewrite the project a couple of times, while these attempts were successful I quickly lost interest and the bot is now down due to lack of hosting.
