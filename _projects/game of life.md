Conway's Game of Life in OpenCV, a small project so I could finish in a couple of days in between assignments.

The development was rather simple and it allowed me to learn about rendereding in OpenCV as well as creaitng game logic. I did run into unexpected bugs around updating the game board whilst calculating on it which I solved by saving the calculations to a copy of the board instead.
